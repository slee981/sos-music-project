It''s that time of year when the whole world is heart to heart
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere
Christmas is love, it''s in the songs we''re singing
Christmas is love, it''s families comin'' home
Christmas is love, it''s on the children''s faces
Christmas is love
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Chirstmas is love, hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it''s sharing in the giving
Christmas is love
We all gather ''round, watch the lights dancing on the tree
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air
Christmas is love, it''s in the songs we''re singing
Christmas is love, it''s families comin'' home
Christmas is love, it''s on the children''s faces
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling

I don''t want a lot for Christmas

Santa Claus won''t make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won''t ask for much this Christmas
I won''t even wish for snow
And I''m just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won''t make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won''t even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
''Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children''s
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won''t you bring me the one I really need?
Won''t you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don''t want a lot for Christmas
This is all I''m asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe
I''ll get a chance to see you

And be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains

You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don''t wanna wake up from you

She tried, but the bitch failed
Like I forgot to put down the salt (Yeah!)
A ''hunnid on the eWay
Shotgun in the briefcase
Spill a bitch brains, look like raspberry cheesecake (B-b-b-boom!)
I got so much money up on the line
I had to put that shit on three-way (Brrring!)

But got a whole shortage in they dick (fuck)
Check stubs look lit (What?)
Money double like Twix (it do)
Fuckers dunno who they wanna be

Get rich or die tryin''

How would I get by baby

All the things we''ve been through
Just you and I together
The good times, the bad times, the sad times

I should have made you leave your key

Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart

I used to cry but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I''m not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free

Your children are playing in that street again
Don''t you know what happened down there?
A youth of fourteen got shot down there
The kokane guns of jamdown town
The killing clowns, the blood money men
Are shooting those washington bullets again
As every cell in chile will tell
The cries of the tortured men
Remember allende, and the days before,
Before the army came
Please remember victor jara,
In the santiago stadium,
Es verdad - those washington bullets again
And in the bay of pigs in 1961,
Havana fought the playboy in the cuban sun,
For castro is a colour,
Is a redder than red,
Those washington bullets want castro dead
For castro is the colour...
...that will earn you a spray of lead
For the very first time ever,
When they had a revolution in nicaragua,
There was no interference from america
Human rights in america
Well the people fought the leader,
And up he flew...
With no washington bullets what else could he do?
''n'' if you can find a afghan rebel
That the moscow bullets missed
Ask him what he thinks of voting communist...
...ask the dalai lama in the hills of tibet,
How many monks did the chinese get?
In a war-torn swamp stop any mercenary,
''n'' check the british bullets in his armoury
Que?
Sandinista!

To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
No matter where I''ll find the time
Of people who don''t wanna see the love of you and me
My love''s infatuation keeps carrying me away
Do I sense anticipation with every thing that you say
But I wonder should I doubt you
When you make things so unclear
Why can''t you say I love you
It''s all I wanna hear
Say the word
And I''ll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word
And I''ll declare time won''t divide
Two people who just wanna be in love eternally
I just know it when I hold you in my arms
You show me that you love me when you smile
You love me why do you back away
If it''s real let me know it when you hold me in your arms
And I show you that I loved you all the while
Say you love me and I''ll never back away

And I''ll be there right by your side
To keep our love alive together we will survive
If you just say the word

Sur les boulevards, dans les faubourgs,
On les voit traÃÂ®ner par centaines,
Leurs guÃÂªtres sales et leurs amours
Dans des chemises de dix sous.
Sous la lumiÃÂ¨re des rÃÂ©verbÃÂ¨res,
Prenant des airs de Pompadour,
Ce sont nos belles ferronniÃÂ¨res,
Ce sont nos poupÃÂ©es, nos guignols, nos pantins.
ÃÂcoutez dans la nuit,
Elles chantent ce refrain:
C''est nous les mÃÂ´mes, les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche,
Clochards qui s''en vont sans un rond en poche.
C''est nous les paumÃÂ©es, les purÃÂ©es d''paumÃÂ©es
Qui sommes aimÃÂ©es un soir n''importe oÃÂ¹.
Nous avons pourtant
CÃÂur pas exigeant
Mais personne n''en veut.
Eh ben tant pis pour eux.
Qu''ÃÂ¨''qu''ÃÂ§a fout,
On s''en fout!
Nul ne s''y accroche.
Il n''y a pas d''amour
Et l''on sera toujours
Les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche!
Mais comme elles n''ont pas les toilettes
Qu''il faut pour les quartiers rupins,
C''est pas aux Galeries Lafayette
Qu''elles vont faire chaque soir leur turbin.
Le long du canal Saint-Martin,
Au SÃÂ©basto, ÃÂ  la chapelle,
On est toujours assez gandin
Pour le monsieur qui vous appelle.
C''est d''l''article populaire, c''est pas du beau joujou.
''y a pas d''poupÃÂ©es en soie
Aux bazars ÃÂ  trente sous.
C''est nous les mÃÂ´mes, les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche,
Clochards qui s''en vont sans un rond en poche.
C''est nous les paumÃÂ©es, les purÃÂ©es d''paumÃÂ©es
Qui sommes aimÃÂ©es un soir n''importe oÃÂ¹.
Tout comme nos ribouis,
Nous n''sommes pas vernies.
Jamais l''on ira
Sur la Riviera.
Qu''ÃÂ¨''qu''ÃÂ§a fout,
On s''en fout!
Quand l''agent nous fauche,
On va faire quatre jours
LÃÂ -bas ÃÂ  la Tour.
Les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche,
Elles ont vendu toutes leurs caresses.
Elles furent payÃÂ©es tant bien que mal,
Puis un jour, plus rien dans la caisse,
Elles vont se fiche dans l''canal
Et sans avoir comme un cheval
La pitiÃÂ© des gens de la rue,
On les emmÃÂ¨ne ÃÂ  l''hÃÂ´pital.
La foule dit  bah, ce n''est qu''une grue
Et voilÃÂ  comment nos poupÃÂ©es, nos pantins,
Lorsqu''elles n''ont plus le sou
S''en vont toutes ÃÂ  Pantin.
C''est nous les mÃÂ´mes, les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche,
Clochards qui s''en vont sans amis, sans proches.
C''est nous les paumÃÂ©es, les purÃÂ©es d''paumÃÂ©es
Qui s''en vont dormir dans l''horrible trou.
DerriÃÂ¨re not'' convoi
Jamais l''on ne voit
Ni fleurs ni couronnes,
Pas mÃÂªme une personne
Qu''ÃÂ¨''qu''ÃÂ§a fout,
On s''en fout!
Quand la mort nous fauche,
C''est not'' plus beau jour.
Cloches, sonnez pour
Les mÃÂ´mes de la cloche!...

Are they howling out or doing somebody harm
On a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm
This is england
This knife of sheffield steel
This is england
This is how we feel
Time on his hands freezing in those clothes
He won''t go for the carrot
They beat him by the pole
Some sunny day confronted by his soul
He''s out at sea, too far off, he can''t go home
This is england
What we''re supposed to die for
This is england
And we''re never gonna cry no more
Black shadow of the vincent
Falls on a triumph line
I got my motorcycle jacket
But I''m walking all the time
South atlantic wind blows
Ice from a dying creed
I see no glory
When will we be free
This is england
We can chain you to the rail
This is england
We can kill you in a jail
This is england
The land of (il)legal dances
This is england
Land of a thousand stances

''Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
You''ve been in the game, your career is long
But when you break it down, you''ve only got two songs
MC''s are like clay pigeons and I''m shootin'' skeet
I just yell pull and MMM drops the beat
You people call yourselves MC''s, but you''re garbage men
Takin'' out the trash when you pull out the pen
And if you don''t like then hey fuck you!

Now talk about your face, now don''t get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist
I keep that hot sauce hot, not mild and weak
It''s gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
I''ve got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
''Cause I''ve got more rhymes, than Carl Sagan''s got turtlenecks
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
You''re hearing me and you''re like Oh my god its Sasquatch!
I''m walkin'' on water, while you''re stepping in shit

With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle
The truth is brutal your grandma''s kugel
Kings County is my stomping ground
The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown
So don''t ask me to wine and dine ya
I''m from Brooklyn you''re from Regina
You''re like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam
You''re just yellin'' and wildin'' wondering who I am?
With those lies you''re telling you look like Toucan Sam

Maybe we share the dream for 20 nights in a row
I would feel better knowing that I was alone

Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth

They find amusing,
Something else to soften a sadistic urge
When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician,
And like the senses that you''re lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core,
Oh I''d twist it more

Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you''d go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won''t last (Last one to know)

What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault),
Seeps into the hollow bones?
Wouldn''t its eyes expand
And zero in like a scope?

Producers for Bonnie: David Mackay, Ronnie Scott, Steve Wolfe
You hate old Chicago, in the winter time
When the cold wind blows right through you
And you said it ain''t no fun
You called west a dream come true
Then one week it got the best of you
On a path lying in that Oklahoma sun
Swore if this day ever came
There''d be no strings, no playing games
Misty eyes and sad goodbyes to say
When love is gone why try to put
A finger on what happened
When somewhere down the road
It slipped away
All I ever wanted was a baby in my arms
A wedding ring and a simple thing called home
All you ever gave me was a look at some old highway
The sky above and the love of a rolling stone
I remember when you told me
That you''d always be a drifting man
And you didn''t need another hungry mouth to feed
And I won''t bring a child into a world between roses
And a thorn and the side of a tumbling tumbleweed
One day you may miss me
But I hope you don''t feel guilty
Go chase the sun until your dying day
But inside me there''s a second little heartbeat
That goes with me
And the one more thing that happened on the way
All I ever wanted was a baby in my arms
A wedding ring and a simple thing called home
All you ever gave me was a look at some old highway
The sky above and the love of a rolling stone

To wallow in blood
Has also denied me

Which poisons our love.

They''re more like tsunami tides in my eyes

Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I''m still drunk at the end of the night
I don''t drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind''s with you but my heart''s just not
So am I close to you anymore, if it''s over?
And there''s no chance that we''ll work it out
That''s why you and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that''s fine
But you''re the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that''s fine
But you''re the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we''d be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down,
Come around, break up the love like lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything''s great, not everything''s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I''m in position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
But we were nervous, on the surface
And I''m always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevent if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss
So am I close to you anymore, if it''s over?

But you''re the only one that knows I lied
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I''d be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I''m thinking I''m unaware
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around,
To make sure I''m not
The only one to feel low
Because if you want
I''ll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I''ve done wrong
And I know you''ll say
That I''m the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
''Cause you and I ended over U.N.I.

Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don''t shop on my hit list

Before I cut up a jam I yell a hocus pocus

And the fame, proclaim, obtains, the stain will gain a rain
That pours, it soars my brain to yours
Ordained by law to train the poor

Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts
Black Sunday or Monday
Black tongues or lungs may cause a black sleep
Why say black sheep?
Black sabbath is evil, black market illegal
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain''t healthy
See, some try to say dark-skinned men ain''t sexy true
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice
Music''s the only thing that brings the dead right back to life
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light
Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y''all

Anything that I give is black magic

Do you believe in magic?
It''s black magic
I believe in
In magic, a dimension of sight and sound
Where people see in only shades of brown
And reality is the same as a fantasy
Is this the way you want your world to be?
Not me, I want variety in my society
Where I can change if I don''t like what I see, you see
This is a woman speakin'' bringin'' door-to-door, seekin''
Tranquilty, that abilty will keep on repeatin''
To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat
Making them dance and laugh is somethin'' quite unique
Abracadabra, Salt''s comin'' at ya

Over ten years and still goin'' strong

Don''t mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise baby, ohh...

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Really good look baby, look here
Sometime wanna be yo'' lover, sometime wanna be yo'' friend

Opened up yo'' heart because you said I make you feel so comfortable

When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we''d always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light...
And in the road before us
Stood a weary greyish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you
The father''s eyes said Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!
The boy''s eyes said
How beautiful!
She shimmers like a star!
The child''s eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are
I turned to look at you
To read my thought upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!
The father''s eyes said Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!
The boy''s eyes said
How beautiful! She glitters like a star!
The child''s eyes uttered nothing
But quiet and utter joy
And stilled my heart with sadness
For the way we are...
And this is why I hate you
And how I understand

Or loves another.

That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Takin'' pictures of my memories, she right there
Twistin'' on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can''t sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I''m doin'' drugs tryin'' to feel you
I''m killin'' me tryin'' to kill you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shoppin'' sprees on whatever coast
How''d you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets
I realize some things never change
Once in love and it''s gone
You don''t look at it the same man
Fuck love ''cause she don''t live here
I''m soaked in blood but I''m still here
Hip hop heartbreaks, straight-laced
Deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feelin'' like I up and left ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college''s professors
Now I regret the day I met ya, I''ll be the first one
To say it, she ain''t the one you want to play with
I fucked hip hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr Dre, O''Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I''m Drake, I''m Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you wanna rap to this bitch
You must commit, then you''re a slave to your grave
You won''t get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm
But the Source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you lickin'' on her
World star kissin'' on her belly, trick on her and onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she''s the object of my affections, god''s essence
God bless her, she bought me Bentleys, Breitlin''s
Made some friends resent me
For writin'' about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I''ll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don''t do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while drivin'' this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I''ll be sorry
But I tried her, used to ride her for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzlin'' on cups of lean
She''s a middle-aged cougar, showin'' young''uns the dream
Notice she wasn''t breathin'' for a second then I screamed
She''s dead and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just lookin'' out for my music family
Wasn''t tryin'' to claim her to myself, she''s yours
You can have her, she''s a motherfuckin'' whore
I fuck hip hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her

Chronic in your system, let me know my shit''s the bomb
Xxplosive
West Coast shit nigga
Overdosage imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch don''t tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes
Captain ''Save-''em-all-day'', well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain''t into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches all for the grip
You punk bitch
All my real doggs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain''t never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checking for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain''t passing nothing but dro indeed
Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds
When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I''m sober you ain''t that fine
Don''t wanna treat you wrong
Don''t wanna lead you on
Here baby hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
While we, still making gangsta hits
You''ll be, still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you''re slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch
I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can''t even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don''t let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your ''64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn''t know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote''
They be beeping me and shit, but we don''t kick it no mo''
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I''m out your pussy when I nut, fo'' real

Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward

Do you want your freedom
From the one you''re thinking of

Naked and yet not knowing
A spell had claimed her heart forever
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square
Fell into an abyss of thin air
Innocent ''n'' caged in sanctuary
There sat the Dragon Lord
Playin'' solitairy
Confined to rule the holy walls ''neath Hell''s Kitchen

Do you want your freedom

Suddenly a voice was heard
FLASH! the brave young man appeared
The Dragon whirled and caught him with his tail
Chased him to the stairway
Caught him halfway to the top
Sent him whirling down --
Fireball, summer solstice
The Dragon Lord descended down on him
She turned to look but saw only darkness silence
You don''t want your freedom
You don''t want my love
You don''t want your soul caught

Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don''t know what it means

with a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can''t take what I got coz I''ll be takin it right back
Cold killin
You wanna know what it''s means? (definition... villain)
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it''s mine
With a baseball cap that''s black that I''m wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin
and wondering why I''m invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it''s convincible
I don''t take no shorts while I''m constructin the ground
that makes y''all move around to my hell of a sound

I go to the party. I hip a hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
aspirin like they''re on fire and
their so-called boyfriends with''em are retirin

A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I''m referrin to this makes ya move ya butt

Anyway I keep the clappin along
coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
[?? huh?? I''m???] who could ask for anything more
when N.W.A. is cold rockin the floor
like stupid, actin like a retard
waitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part

writin my lyrics with this hyped information
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
It''s mine!
Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed
It''s irresistable, meanin that you can''t avoid
And while I''m on stage, look forward to sweat

Yeah I like that better
(?? huh?? As what I can do??) I think I earn respect
And if I didn''t from you, that''s what I expect
coz if it ain''t ruff it ain''t me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I''m just me standin at the top of the pile
and doin soft known tunes it ain''t my style
And this concludes our program
of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb
It''s no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics that''s promised to play
to make everybody say:
(They can be cold and ruthless no question about that,
but sometimes it''s more complicated...)
Yo Dre (You know what I want you to do?)
Bring that beat back, bring that beat back
Now MC Ren is here workin like super glue
No matter what I do, I''m always thinkin o'' you
Coz I''m the pusher, supplyin the fix
And this jam''s so dope, it don''t need a remix
But I''m makin obstacles of enemy traps
to catch any MC''s with the weak-ass raps
Crucifyin their [?? huh??] like just for usin my name
The definition is pain, but that''s the thing o'' the game
If they try to retreat, I catch''em one at a time
coz they''re comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme
So, you''re in the back of me just listen and learn
because you''ll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my sideman wants to give a preview
so at my next concert I wanna see you
there not sittin in a chair
standin on yo feet, with yo hand in the air
Now I''m about to get out but I''ll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track
deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
with lyrics that''s smooth to start some discussion

Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on

Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time

posse in this muthaf**ka to rocl on this funky ass beat we''re gonna drop
Aight, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this muthaf**ka, run it

Picture a nigga that''s raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what''s on
Muthaf**kas I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, f**k the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a handgrenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can''t throw me, I guess you''ll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it''ll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can''t manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter steppin is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I''m gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo'' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
''Cause I''ll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment''s the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo'' body twitch, your eye''s explode
Out your skull ''cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn''t know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What''s left is a muthaf**ka dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale

Yea, yea that was funky but we need the muthaf**king villian to speak
So kick it

The grand finale, yo, it''s my turn to bust
So let weak muthaf**kas turn to dust
If you''re weak it ain''t my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that''s biting just to taste me
I make the punk muthaf**kas buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he''s caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain ''cause I''m urgent
Rearrange the muthaf**king face like a surgeon
It ain''t no excuse for the torture delivering
Don''t say that I scare you, I can tell ''cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say f**k the police, yo, so now they after me
I''m wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a?(cell pimp)?
For what, maybe ''cause I''m Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So f**k it, sit back cool and relax

An everyday situation where I would stalk by

Run house and there won''t be no disagreeing
''Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I''m arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why ''cause they''re addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
''Cause they''re paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don''t give a f**k about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a muthafuking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
''Cause all the other bullshit money ain''t jack

Especially if you''re poppin bullshit

This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it''s kinda cool (Tell ''em why), I''m making money
Tripping up the man wit the?(swig tan)? movement
Proving if you''re grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
''Cause I''m the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would''ve been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It''s rough, I mean it''s funky enuff for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-''T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I''m just better than
The normal man and I''ll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it''s like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I''m a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the muthafuking grand finale

Shit I said suck the mothafucka, you''re bitin'' it, shit!
Has this ever happend to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she''s sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and buy
NWA''s new book entitled The art of sucking dick.
Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick
next you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth
Take it slow, don''t rush it, and before you know it .
SPLASH!
It goes one for the treble, two for the bass
She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...
Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho''
Cought on the late night, Stampin'' on the base-pipe
She''s a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started givin'' up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather
Every time I asked her what''s the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I''m sayin''
I wanted a date, she would''nt even be my friend
But now in the 1990''s, I''d be praying that the bitch don''t find me
Cuz she''s got a gang o'' kidz nappy-heads and all dirty
And she''s gettin pimped by a nigga that''s thirty
I saw her hangin'' in the alley
Raggin to her friends how she''s ho''in'' in de valley
All by herself, doin'' on the hoe stroll
Comin back home late night with the bankroll
You know a bitch like that makes me sick
But I''ve heard that she sucks a good dick
It''s the world''s biggest dick
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
It''s the world''s biggest dick
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
What do you want me to do with it?
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
She swallowed it At a high school dance -
Me and the niggaz bailed in
I saw her sittin'' with her friends, With the clan,
So sexy, thought she was all that
She would''nt even look it up because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
On the streets she''s a late night feature - walkin home from school
I saw her suckin a niggaz dick, under the bleacher
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut could''nt escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw her
There was''nt a nigga on the block
Late at night not gettin'' done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course
cause my dick yo it''s harder than a totem pole
Then again it don''t concern me
Cuz there''s a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot de ho''
I mean checkin'' with de quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from gettin'' sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick
It''s the world''s biggest dick
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
It''s the world''s biggest dick
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don''t matter just don''t bite it
She swallowed it Now I was at a club on a late late Sunday
Peepin'' at the bitches ''till the next day Monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I locked her
She was at the end of the bar gettin'' fucked up
Back at the house she was bitch n'' be ignorin
And when she start to talk the ho'' was kinda borin
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she''s dancin'' on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shakin'' that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I''m a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she''s with it
Oh and when she turned sobber should''nt have had admit it
So while she''s dropped I''d better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick .
It''s the world''s biggest dick
Don''t matter just don''t bite it

Don''t matter just don''t bite it
What do you want me to do with it?

But does she suck a good dick?
Don''t matter just don''t bite it

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers'' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Can profit you
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out, or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
Brushes with darkness won''t help you create
Your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

Till I really couldn''t take no more

too young, too dumb to realize
that I should''ve bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby''s dancing
but she''s dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused the good strong woman like you
to walk out my life
now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should''ve bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby''s dancing
but she''s dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I''ll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I''m probably too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take to every party
cause I remember how much you loved to dance
do all the things I should have done
when i was your man
do all the things I should have done

Enough of frankfurters answering back

And a mayor, five foot two
No other town in the whole forty eight

It blinks, it tilts, it rings
To think that I''ve lived here all of my life
And never seen these things

By bus, by train

Star to be NYC
Just got here this morning
Three bucks, two bags
One me,
NYC
I give you fair warning
Up there in lights I''ll be
Go ask the Gershwins or Kaufman and Hart
The place they love the best
Though California pays big for their art
Their fan mail comes addressed to NYC
Tomorrow a penthouse
That''s way up high
Tonight the Y
Why not?
It''s NYC

You''re still the champ

Lit Chanel that you''ve wrapped around yourself

Who arguably kidnapped a kid on the wall
While your designers have slyly directed the eye
Down clean lines in your well-lit hall

What a waste that that''s all that you have
Oh, you wrote your thesis on the Gospel of Thomas
You shot some reversal film in Angkor Wat
And this book you once read say there''s less people dead
At this point now than those who are not
And this film we once saw was reviled for its flaws
But its flaws were what made us have fun
And the life some folks had might have made us feel bad
Why feel bad man, it''s nothing that you''ve done
It''s all in your hand
It''s all in your hand
Like a gun, like a globe, like a grand
And this thing you once said disappeared from my head
In the time that it took to be amazed
And this thing you once did might have dazzled the kids

And lately I fall a lot

I''m gonna tell you a story
And there''s no moral to be made
But don''t forget when your dancing
That somehow the piper must be paid
Down on the Nile in the southern sea''s
There lives a lassy named Minne Breeze
And all the natives agree that she''s
The hottest thing in Trinidad
When Minne dances I guarantee
With every move of her vertebrae
The temperature jump up ten degree
In Trinidad that isn''t bad
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives would be so sad
If Minne ever left Trinidad
Although the natives loved Minne so
Minne had herself a steady bow
A fellow known as Calypso Joe
And Minnie swore they''d never part
But they stepped in only as they could
Min won a contest for dancing good
So she went away to Hollywood
When Joe heard that, it broke his heart
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, she wasn''t good but she wasn''t bad
Aye, aye, aye, Calypso Joe was so very sad
When Minne up and left Trinidad
In Hollywood Minne traveled far
They changed her name to Minne Lamar
And pretty soon she became a star
The siren of the picture show
But one day Minne got awful mad
A guy got fresh and she said You cad
My heart belongs to my Trinidad
My Trinidad Calypso Joe
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, in Hollywood Minne met her cad
Aye, aye, aye, but there is only one native lad
Gets chinny with Minne from Trinidad
So Minnie gave up her dough and fame
And she went back to from where she came
But when she got there she heard with shame
That her Calypso Joe was dead
When Minne heard that, she almost died
She took a gun to try suicide
But as she started to shoot
She cried, I think I''d rather live instead
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, she went away and they were so sad
Aye, aye, aye, but now the natives are mighty glad
''Cause Minne came back to Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives will be so sad
If Minne, Minne came back to Trinidad
Aye, aye, aye

To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
We listened to Papa''s translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
A way to find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough and all else fades
Fades away

With something dyin'' inside of me
Grew up with great expectations
Heard the promise and I knew the plan
They say people get what they deserve
But Lord, sometimes it''s much worse than that
Maryanne she''s takin'' in some laundry
I got a part-time job at a drive-in stand
Oh Lord, what did I do
To deserve these empty hands
CHORUS
Across the cities, across the land
Through the valleys and across the sand
Too many people standin'' in line
Too many people with nothin'' planned
There''s too many people with empty hands
Now Maryanne''s been cryin''
Lord knows I love her the best I can
When my pride is bruised and broken
She slips her hand into my empty hands
Without hope, without love, you''ve got nothing but pain
Just makes a man not give a damn
That''s no way for us to live
We''ve got to fill these empty hands
CHORUS

One night in Vegas
It was a morning of revenge for what I did the night before
Which accompanied me to the following day to even up the score
In a stone cold sober mood next afternoon at ten
I found my tongue back in my mouth
And I told myself not to drink again
One night in Vegas
I was three sheets to the wind
The three shots did me in
Three angels there above me
As I was lying on the floor
I knew I should have run for the hills
But I still wanted more
I don''t remember the chapel but I woke up with a wife
I looked at her, she looked at me and now we''re hooked for life
How strange the situation, it''s now been thirty years
Since I met that girl in Vegas
And would you believe it, she''s still here

' ),(122, ' I Love You Too, Death ', 'Who is much more than a friend,
But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end,
In the blackness there''s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets,
Every stranger is a ghost
Cashiers won''t deduct the pain,
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color''s faded out
Let''s go camping in the cold,
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old,
Re-send pigeons that were sent
Try to memorize your smell,
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guys recast in steel
Birds don''t cry when echoes quit,
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks,
Knowing winter''s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming your the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own,
If there''s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine''s a black heart you could flip
I''ve come to terms with what I have,
What''s been given, what''s been asked
Turn my back against the sea,
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns,
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in the park
I can''t touch you only once,
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house,
And stick my toes just past the door
Let me know when I''m in love,
Let me die when I''m in love

Und Geld macht mich nicht reich
Manchmal ist Leben schwer
Und meistens finde ich es leicht
Ich hab geweint
Und ich hab gelacht
Und endlich rausgefunden
Was mich schÃÂ¶ner macht
Ich hab getrunken
Und ich hab geraucht
Und ich hab meine KrÃÂ¤fte
Komplett aufgebraucht
Und wenn ich wieder
Auf die Beine komme
Ist immer wieder Leben
Ist immer wieder Sonne

HÃÂ¤ltst meine Hand und lachst
Weil du mich besser kennst als ich

Bin ich oft geflogen
Ich hab auch schon gelogen
Und dich und mich betrogen
Ich flog hinauf zum Himmel
Und bin ganz tief gesunken
Und ich lass mich hÃÂ¤ngen
Und steh dann wieder auf
Ich leb so gesund
Und Drogen nehm ich auch
Ich zÃÂ¤hl die Jahre
Und ich zÃÂ¤hl sie nicht
Ich steh im Dunkeln
Und ich mag das Licht
Und hier bist du
HÃÂ¤ltst meine Hand und lachst
Weil du mich besser kennst als ich
Ich bin verliebt in dich
Mein Leben will
Ich mir nicht vorstellen ohne dich
Ich liebe manche Menschen
Und manche lieben mich
Und die die mich nicht lieben
Die vermisse ich nicht
Ich liebe meine Kinder
Und ich liebe dich
Und manchmal fÃÂ¼hl ich gar nichts
Dann fÃÂ¼hl ich nicht mal mich
Ich wÃÂ¼nsch mir Frieden
Und Gelassenheit
Ein Herz das immer warm ist
Ich bin noch nicht so weit
Freiheit tut mir gut
Ich tu mir manchmal weh
Ich fÃÂ¼hl mich stark
Auch wenn ich gerade
Nicht so gerade steh
Meine Angst vorm Sterben
Verwandelt sich in Luft
LÃÂ¶st sich langsam auf
Weil mich das Leben ruft
Und hier bist du
HÃÂ¤ltst meine Hand und lachst
Weil du mich besser kennst als ich
Ich bin verliebt in dich
Mein Leben will
Ich mir nicht vorstellen ohne dich
Mit dir will ich weiter und ich folge dir
Und du nimmst immer auch von mir
Ich bin verliebt in dieses Leben

Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;

Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in Nature''s gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history''s page, let every stage
Advance Australia fair!
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia fair!
Verse Two
When gallant Cook from Albion sail''d,
To trace wide oceans o''er,
True British courage bore him on,
Till he landed on our shore.
Then here he raised Old England''s flag,
The standard of the brave;
With all her faults we love her still,
Brittannia rules the wave!
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!
Verse Three
Beneath our radiant southern Cross,
We''ll toil with hearts and hands;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands;
For those who''ve come across the seas
We''ve boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!
Verse Four
While other nations of the globe
Behold us from afar,
We''ll rise to high renown and shine
Like our glorious southern star;
From England, Scotia, Erin''s Isle,
Who come our lot to share,
Let all combine with heart and hand
To advance Australia fair!
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!
Verse Five
Shou''d foreign foe e''er sight our coast,
Or dare a foot to land,
We''ll rouse to arms like sires of yore
To guard our native strand;
Brittannia then shall surely know,
Beyond wide ocean''s roll,
Her sons in fair Australia''s land
Still keep a British soul.
In joyful strains the let us sing
Advance Australia fair!

So what you want me to do? Express yourself
I''m expressin'' with my full capabilities
And now I''m livin'' in correctional facilities
''Cause some don''t agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I''m droppin'' flava, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and it''ll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
''Cause they don''t flow like this one
You know what? I won''t hesitate to diss one
Or two before I''m through, so don''t try to sing this
Some drop science while I''m droppin'' English
Even if Yella, makes it acapella
I still express, yo, I don''t smoke weed or sess
''Cause it''s known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don''t manage nuthin''

Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin'' ain''t their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you''re on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes with no help
There''s no fessin'' or guessin'' while I''m expressin'' myself
It''s crazy to see people be what society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you will hear none
They''d rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin'' for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say hell no
But you know it ain''t all about wealth
As long as you make a note to express yourself
Express yourself
Go on and do it
Express yourself
Express yourself
Go on and do it
Express yourself

Then expression is a big part of it
You ain''t efficient when you flow, you ain''t swift
Movin'' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There''s a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of them expression
And if you start fessin'', I got a Smith & Wesson for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It''s Dre on the mic, gettin'' physical

Yes, I''ma calm but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin'' just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he''s up to no good
When I start expressin'' myself, Yella, slam it
''Cause if I stay funky like this I''m doin'' damage
Or I''ma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it''s like, it''s like we''re gettin'' hyped tonight

Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand

With potential to get bad as fuck
So I''m a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don''t give a fuck to say
Fuck the police I''m tired of the muthafuckin jackin
Sweatin my gang while I''m chillin in the shackin
Shining tha light in my face, and for what
Maybe it''s because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ''cause I blast
On a stupid assed nigga when I''m playin with the trigga
Of any Uzi or an AK
''cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
''cause my identity by itself causes violence

Yeah, I''m a gansta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot,
By me, or another nigga.
And with a gat it don''t matter if he''s smaller or bigger
And as you all know, E''s here to rule
Whenever I''m rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
And there''s no cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And if I''m rollin off the 8, he''ll be tha one

I wanna grow old with you
' ),(245, ' Machine Gun Funk ', 'So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can''t feel that hardcore
Appeal that you''re screaming
Maybe I''m dreaming
This ain''t Christopher Williams, still some
MC''s got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: Biggie off the street, it''s a miracle!
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat''ll kill you quicker
Especially when I''m drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It''s natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I''m broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don''t mean I don''t tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I''m doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I''m real hard to find now
Cause I''m knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I''ll make you prove that it''s bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That''s why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
What''s love got to do?
When I''m ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don''t sling guns
I got bags of funk and it''s selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It''s type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I''ll die for the funk

Hung my head, as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
The rain came pouring down when I was drowning

And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do

When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
(Ahh, ahh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That''s when I could finally breathe
And by morning

Blow a case a nigga throwing shots, I run ''em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot

Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro

From distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward
Against an unforgiving wilderness, yes we can
It was the call of workers who organized
Women who reached for the ballots
A President who chose the moon as our new frontier
And a King who took us to the mountaintop
And pointed the way to the Promised Land
Yes we can to justice and equality
Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity
Yes we can heal this nation
Yes we can repair this world
Yes we can
We know the battle ahead will be long
But always remember that no matter
What obstacles stand in our way
Nothing can stand in the way of the power
Of millions of voices calling for change
(We want change)
We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics
They will only grow louder and more dissonant
We''ve been asked to pause for a reality check
We''ve been warned against offering
The people of this nation false hope
But in the unlikely story that is America
There has never been anything false about hope
Now the hopes of the little girl who goes
To a crumbling school in Dillon are the same
As the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA
We will remember that there is something happening in America
That we are not as divided as our politics suggests
That we are one people, we are one nation
And together, we will begin the next great chapter
In the American story with three words that will ring
From coast to coast, from sea to shining sea, yes we can

with a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can''t take what I got coz I''ll be takin it right back
(Ruthless gangsta) Cold killin
You wanna know what it''s means? (definition... villain)
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it''s mine
With a baseball cap that''s black that I''m wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin
and wondering why I''m invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it''s convincible
I don''t take no shorts while I''m constructin the ground
that makes y''all move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin
(Dr.Dre: Yo Ren, tell''em what they do when you start rhymin)

I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot

A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I''m referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
but don''t stand in a daze, yeah you should know what''s up
Anyway I keep the clappin along
coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
(?? huh?? I''m???) who could ask for anything more
when N.W.A. is cold rockin the floor
like stupid, actin like a retard
waitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part
It tips me so with temptation
writin my lyrics with this hyped information
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines

(?? huh?? As what I can do??) I think I earn respect
And if I didn''t from you, that''s what I expect
coz if it ain''t ruff it ain''t me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I''m just me standin at the top of the pile
and doin soft known tunes it ain''t my style
And this concludes our program
of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb
It''s no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics that''s promised to play
to make everybody say:
(They can be cold and ruthless no question about that,
but sometimes it''s more complicated...)
(Eazy E: Yo Dre) (You know what I want you to do?)
(Public Enemy: Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)
Now MC Ren is here workin like super glue
No matter what I do, I''m always thinkin o'' you

And climbed up the mountainside

To help me from another lifetime
We took each others hands and cried
Like a river when we said hello
And we walked to Tir Na Nog

On a golden autumn day
We were standing in the garden wet with rain
And our souls were young again in Tir Na Nog
And outside the storm was raging
Outside Jerusalem
We drove in our chariots of fire
Following the big sun in the west
Going up going up to Tir Na Nog

Where the roads were quiet and still

The only way then is to never come back
Except I that wouldn''t want that would you
If we weren''t together again in Tir Na Nog

And we loved each other then as well

Many many many times you kissed mine eyes

Poised on the brink of eternity

As only drunken soldiers can
And passed from man to man
A wanton child, too dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed
As nothing less than the end of an age
A last crusade, a final outrage
In this day of flaccid plumage
And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together

They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
The smell of oil and gas in the air
Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
The old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a solitary shaft of chromium steel

Or he''ll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi

If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I''ll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling Fuck me, two weeks she''ll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese''s pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy''s, y''all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

I will
Smoke a little something but I don''t inhale, everywhere that I go, everywhere

Take me to the bedroom, let you know me well, I mean normally, you see
Norma Jean wouldn''t kick it with Farmer Phil, but these kids these days, they get so

You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That''s the new principle, sometimes I''mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I''mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I''m the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause I''m addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I''m the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Cooler like I''m offa codeine, low key
Don''t be so judgmental, even though I''m reminiscing
If I don''t know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that it''s home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I''m thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes

And stagger out the door
And head into the bright new

And the way she pulls me in
Sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
Never smile never stare
She doesn''t seem to care at all
Never cry never scream
She doesn''t really seem
To need me at all...
Fourteen weeks I stay away from home
A hundred days a part of me unknown
A part in pink
And perfect moments play
And as a wonder of the world
She sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
So I asked her could be heaven?
And she just prayed me it...
She didn''t want to know my name
She didn''t want to know
How long we had together
Spending time as if
Tomorrow never comes
I didn''t want to know the end
I didn''t want to go but
Slowly found me home again
And slow again tomorrow comes...
But it was all so far away
And so long ago
I hardly ever think about her anymore
Except sometimes
When the summer twilight breeze
Carries me the scent of faraway rain
I remember...
And she still sucks my breath away

I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
(chorus)
But I''m sad to say I''m on my way
Won''t be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sad to say I''m on my way
Won''t be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town.

All you hear is I like you ''bout to start daring
None of this the same like it was in the past
I want you to pay attention, they want you to pay the tab
Convincing myself like it ain''t that bad
See a problem and skip over it like a YouTube ad
I confront you with some shit, you say it ain''t that deep
Yeah, it ain''t that deep until a bitch go and cheat
You gotta fix this, you acting fishy like fish sticks
You buggin'' like bugs surrounding at picnics
Don''t take this to heart but we losing our spark
You only come through at night like glow-in-the-dark
Give me more than the dick, man, get on your shit
So many make ups for fuck ups follow real quick
Man, scratch that, all our good times in my flashback
All you had to do was add 21, no blackjack
Feet hurted, I was on your back like a backpack
See, all I do is reminisce and sit back and backtrack
The kisses ain''t the same and the hugs ain''t the tighest
I don''t even smile and when I do it ain''t the whitest
Been with you for a day in a room full of silence
If love don''t cost a thing, why the fuck am I so biased?

Walk away, you want me back
I walk away like girl, you snapped
I walk away, I won''t be back

It''s a trap to get me back where you want me
I know I''m a snack but that don''t mean treat me like a junkie
All you had to do was make me smile like Bridget
I shouldn''t have to tweet, I''m single for male attention
Everything good then we fuck and make up
The same night you sneaking out if I don''t fucking stay up
Yo, I''m tight, am I done fussing? Not quite
I can''t stand and be polite
I don''t beat around the bush, I''m not ''aight
Done tryna be patient, I''m so irritated
I just wanna know what we''re doing
Telling people that I''m taken
When there''s other things I wanna be pursuing

Mystery after gala night
It says mystery of soprano''s flight
Mystified all the papers say
We are mystified, we suspect foul play
Bad news on soprano''s scene
First Carlotta now Christine
Still, at least, the seats get sold
Gossip''s worth its weight in gold
Diva tenders resignation
Cover does a moonlight flit
Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you''re sure to have a hit!
(Andre interrupting)
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
(Firmin)
Andre please don''t shout!
It''s publicity!
And the take is vast
Free publicity!
(Andre)
But we have no cast!
(Firmin)
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Ah, it seems you''ve got one too
(Andre, reading)
Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva''s a disaster, must you cast her when she''s seasons past her prime!?!
(Firmin, reading)
Dear, Firmin
Just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost by return of post
P.T.O
No one likes a debtor so it''s better if my orders are obeyed!

Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
(Firmin)
These are both signed O.G.
(Andre)
Who the hell is he?
(Both realizing)
Opera Ghost!
(Firmin)
It''s nothing short of shocking
(Andre)
He is mocking our position!
(Firmin)
In addition he wants money!
(Andre)
What a funny apparition!
(Both)
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer, he is clearly quite insane!

Where is she?
(Firmin)
You mean Carlotta?

I mean Miss Daae
Where is she?

Well how should we know?

Carlotta: Christine Daae!
(Raoul contiues)...will be singing on your behalf tonight
Be prepared for a great misfortune
Should you attempt to take her place.

Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine!
All we''ve heard since we came is Miss Daae''s name--!

Miss Daae has returned.

No, Monsieur

Here, I have a note

Let me see it!
(Firmin, reaching for note)
Please
Gentlemen,
I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not...
(fading to the Phantom''s voice)
followed my instructions
I shall give you one last chance
(Phantom singing)
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent, which makes my casting, in a word, ideal
(Phantom talking)
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O.G.
(Carlotta)
Christine!
(Andre)
Whatever next?
(Carlotta)
It''s all a plot to help Christine!

This is insane...

I know who sent this:
The Vicomte -- her lover!

Indeed?
Can you believe this?

You''re only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!

I''m gonna try to keep myself together

Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you, no no, no no baby
The only place I want to be is right here with you
Loving you down and you
You can take what you want from me

Hang around

It''s something we''d regret someday

There''s nobody but me to blame
I''ve gotta speak my mind, and deal with the situation
Open the lines

The capital,
And people said
Don''t stop,
Until you play the Palace,
you haven''t played the top.
For years I had it preached to me,
And drummed into my head,
Until you play the Palace,
You might as well be dead.
A team of hoofers was the headline,
At the Majestic, down in Dallas.
But they canceled the day,
Their agent called to say,
You can open the bill at the palace.
So, it became the Hall of Fame,
The Mecca of the trade.
When you had played the Palace,
You knew that you were made.
So, I hope you understand my wondrous thrill,
''cause Vaudevilles back as the Palace,
And I''m on the bill.
Shine on
Shine on
Harvest moon
Up in the sky
I aint had no lovin
Since January
Febuary
June or July
Some of these days
Your gonna miss me honey
Some of these days
Your gonna feel so lonely
You miss my hugging
You miss my kissing
You''ll miss me honey
When I''m far away
Oh my man
I love him so
He''ll never know
All my life is just despaire
But i dont care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright alright
I dont care
I dont care
If people frown
On me
I''m happy go lucky
They say that I''m plucky
Contented and carefree,
I dont care
I dont care
If he''s a clerk or just a millionare,
If im not successful
It wont be degressful
''cause I dont care.
And all around me
I hear voices that I can''t ignore.
The voices of the stars
Who played the Palace long before.
The stars who entertained you,
Until the rafters rang.
You dont need there names
For the whole world acclaims them
For the wonderful songs they sang.
Theres Eddie Canter,
Georgie Jessle,
Louie Holts,
Johnson and olson.
Cowerson boys,
Howerdson boys
Aand that singing fool Al Jolson.
And so with deep humility,
I stand in front of you
I''m proud to play the palace,
It''s like a dream come true,
Which is why I''d like to shout it up and down.
Just to tell Broadway
That the two a day is back in town.

They came from near,they came from far
Following a distance star to where He lay
Not being sure of what it mean,but
Knowing it was their way
And the creatures gathered ''round
And didn''t make a sound
And the angels cried
The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His son
From up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see and
Knowing of His destiny
Came tears of love
I''ve often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized
That star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land
The Son of God would soon become
The Son of Man
And the creatures gathered ''round
And didn''t make a sound
And the angels cried
And the Angel Cried

To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we''re so in love
Fighting against all odds, I know we''ll be alright this time

Down and down and down some more depression
But I now there''ll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, I''m not giving up
So you rock around and think that you''re the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you''re streets away from where it gets the roughest

Raise the window
Its getting hot in here
All these breathers
And all of these suckers
Shake my hand now
Pleased to meet you but
Skin is pretty
But underneath you''re a monster
Are we friends now
Am I your brother
Can we bleed together
Are we lovers
Let''s sew our pants together
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let''s climb right in forever
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Then won''t we all be so clever
If we sew our pants together
Wake the next morning
One below the waist
But you want poached eggs
And I want to go to the bathroom
What do we do now
What do we make of this
Can my blood flow
Apart from your stitch
Let''s sew our pants together
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let''s climb right in forever
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Then won''t we all be so clever
If we sew our pants together
Lets set our hair on fire
Lets throw our hearts in the mire
Lets sell our eggs to any buyer
We''ve made a liar of desire
Lets sew our pants together
Lets sew our pants together
We''ve made a liar of desire
We''ve made a liar of desire
We''ve made a liar of desire

A tiny little seed is sown,
A government is overthrown,
Who knows when we''ll be coming home at last
And I heard it on the radio
That one day we''ll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a tv show
That somewhere up above
And in my heart
They''ll be tearing us apart,
Maybe moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars,
Maybe moving us to mars
We won''t see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged

We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again you and me
We are meeting for the first time

We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

Past the satellites and stars
They''re moving us to mars

I bent this thing over like I took a bow
Dick in my pum pum may get lost and drown
Niggas get in this pussy and lose in lost and found
Now you wanna act like you starstruck
Pussy woke you up like some Starbucks
I give you so much head even though you love ass
That yo pubic hair starting to make me a mustache
But that''s some other shit, this pussy smother dick
BET where the fuck my award for sucking dick?
I like the way you stroking it daddy keep focusing
You the first to come inside like this pussy the grand opening
Murder my pussy without the gunshot
Just shoot me up my ass crack with a cum shot
Sore out my body like pilates, boy don''t stop
Just cover all my gums up with a cum shot
Cum shot, cum shot
In my crotch, my crotch
(Cum shot, cum shot
In my crotch, my crotch)
I''m more happy than a happy meal those jaws work
Celebrity with a wet pussy call that Starburst
Can I measure it with a ruler, papi chulo?
Hit a split on that dick in the back of the Uber
Pussy bust open like I''m going in labor
The coochie to the booty it got different flavors
Anytime I wanna make my ass smack on yo cock
You better pop up out the blue like Jack in the Box
I''m frisky I might give that dick a hickey
If sucking dick was a drug I''m overdosing like Whitney
Drop it in my kitty let me feel it in my kidney
Yo pants full of dick so we calling em Dickies
I fuck niggas and get fucked without a ring
Pussy taste like pork chops and sour cream
Place you in a dream once I give you this sample
Then I model yo sperm just call me Naomi Campbell
Murder my pussy without the gunshot
Just shoot me up my ass crack with a cum shot
Sore out my body like pilates, boy don''t stop
Just cover all my gums up with a cum shot
Cum shot, cum shot
In my crotch, my crotch
(Cum shot, cum shot
In my crotch, my crotch)
Yo balls sagging, I''m gagging and its taking my oxygen
Suck it so good have you shocker than Chaka Khan
Whoa, whoa minute man that''s a no no
Buy me gifts than I turn into yo ho ho
What''s the rush? Can I douche or do you want a stank twat?
Pussy dripping on that dick like a raindrop
Wanted the big dick until you made me face it
Dick was so hard it broke my tooth I need braces
How can a nigga ever hate this pussy?
I walk into the barber like shave this pussy
I took off my shorts, long story short (oh yeah)
That nigga ate this pussy!
Fuck every hole on my body that''s including my ear
Keep my panties when you done as a souvenir
Freakiest girl in the world if you wanna get technical
Don''t test me unless its with your testicles
Taking trips, I''m skinny dippin and then let''s fuck in McDonalds
Caramel Frappe full of cum boy you know that''s the motto

I wear my Kylie Jenner lipstick on my pussy lips
On my pussy lips, on my pussy lips

At least he threw me records, that made heads fly
Sit down to write and the pen blazed fire
Construct a rhyme, with specific intent
Flippin all the braincells right to the pen
And then I put the root down when I hold the mic
Words flowin so cold turn water to ice
Come through to rock such a rate to tape
You put me in the mix like {?} up at the plate
And then they press it on wax, sell it in the store
The DJ''s screamin kick it out on the dancefloor
Comin through the speaker to shake your eardrum

Och many times often ye met me
And told me that I should be
You darling, Acushla,
A Lana Mavourneen, Asuilish machree
Purty girl, purty girl,
With no on there to show her how
The purt, purt, purty girl is now
Milking her cow
I have not the manners or graces
Of the girls in the world where ye move
And I have not their beautiful faces
But oh, I''ve a heart that can love
And if it please ye, I''ll dress me in satin
With jewels, jewels in me brow
But och, don''t be after forgettin''
Your purty girl milking her cow
Purty girl, purty cow,
I''m sure this song would have never been wrote
If the pretty girl hadda been milking her goat
But the goat wasn''t feeling well anyhow
So the pretty girl was milking her cow.
Her cow, her cow...

Consultin'' with the rain.

If I only had a brain.
I''d unravel every riddle for any individ''le,
In trouble or in pain.
With the thoughts I''d be thinkin''
I could be another Lincoln
If I only had a brain.
Oh, I could tell you why The ocean''s near the shore.
I could think of things I never thunk before.
And then I''d sit, and think some more.
I would not be just a nuffin'' my head all full of stuffin''
My heart all full of pain.
I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry,
If I only had a brain.
Heart
When a man''s an empty kettle he should be on his mettle,
And yet I''m torn apart.
Just because I''m presumin'' that I could be kind-a-human,
If I only had heart.
I''d be tender - I''d be gentle and awful sentimental
Regarding Love and Art.
I''d be friends with the sparrows ...
and the boys who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart.
Picture me - a balcony. Above a voice sings low.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat....
How sweet.
Just to register emotion, jealousy - devotion,
And really feel the part.
I could stay young and chipper
and I''d lock it with a zipper,
If I only had a heart.
The Nerve
Life is sad, believe me, Missy,
When you''re born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve.
But I could change my habits, never more be scared of rabbits
If I only had the nerve.
I''m afraid there''s no denyin'' I''m just a dandelion,
A fate I don''t deserve.
But I could show my prowess, be a lion not a mowess
If I only had the nerve
Oh I''d be in my stride, a king down to the core
I would roar the way I''ve never roared before
And then I''d rrrwoof! and roar some more
I would show the dinosaurus who''s king around the forres''
A king they better serve
Why with my regal beezer I could be another Caesar
If I only had the nerve

And away run he
With that melody
Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he revamped it with a new off-beat
And the classic thing,
Got a shot of swing
Mr. Brahms cried och!
So did Mozart and Bach
And to hear them rave
Paginini tumbled over in his grave
And now that tune, that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop
And it couldn''t, STOP!
Now it''s number one thanks to Tom the piper''s son.

But he vamped it with a boogie beat
And the classic thing,

So did Debussy and Bose

Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade

All it''s sweetness In some appealing little gesture
All of it''s own.

Eyes went deep into a trance
Until he hit me with the I wanna be friends
I''m talking Michigan, straight up out the blue
I feel sick as fuck, and no, it ain''t the flu
So devastated, this elevated into a breakup
Like a elevator, baby, I wanted to take this way up
I''m in shock, how did our relationship flop
I want a man who walk in the door and never think to knock
Took me to another level
Then showin'' your true colors, got more than Fruity Pebbles
We was closer than siblings
How I''m supposed to be willing to bury my feelings
If I never owned a shovel?
Every time I let my walls down, everything falls down
Why wait till months pass to say let''s pause now
Tryna'' keep a dog in a relation is so clown
When dogs don''t even wanna be in the dog pound

Gave him the key to my heart, I should of kept me a spare

No wonder why he had more phones than Best Buy
Must be hiding shit, maybe with a island bitch
Was so blind, I could come check my eyes real quick
Could''ve at least left for two minutes like you had to go potty
But you left me here forever, now I have nobody
I thought if I sit around, and let it keep me down

Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo''d up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won''t stop, it go
Head over heels in love
Right in front of you, ain''t gotta look no more baby (hah)
I wanna build this love
And everything you want, you ain''t gotta ask for
You got me boo''d up, boo''d up
Boo''d up, boo''d up
Told you from the jump I''m the one to choose
Ya got me boo''d up, boo''d up
Boo''d up, boo''d up
Grab me by the waist baby, pull me closer
Ooh, no I''ll never get over you until I find something new

' ),(116, ' Take It Back ', 'I''m not a rapper I''m a singer with a flow
I''ve got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You''ll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signed to a label
But didn''t listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn''t
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is the system
And you could say that I''m driven
And now it''s onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I''ll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I''m avoiding the ''caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it''s safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don''t wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don''t you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I''ll be singing the news
Tryin'' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin'' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that''s what they''re supposed to do
And I''m supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I''ll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I''ve never had an enemy
Except the NME but I''ll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I''m battling for respect and I don''t know if I have it
This song''s from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don''t you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I don''t ever wanna be perfect
Cause I''m a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone''s got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
''Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I''ll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
''Cause that how it''s supposed to be
I''m screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life''s dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I''m never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we''ll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that''s how we plan it out
It''s time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don''t you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don''t you fade into the back love
No

I never knew that I was standing in the rain
My mind was wandering back to you again
There''s a thousand miles between us
Though it feels a thousand more
Cos tonight I sleep alone
I never realized how time could drag on
Never thought about how long the days are
And I never heard my heart beat
Till the first night you were gone
Then I know I was alone
(Refrain:)
When I close my eyes and I think of you
I don''t feel so bad, I don''t feel so blue
When I need you here, all I do
I close my yes
Then I''m with you
I could see miracles
They wouldn''t mean a thing
I don''t want memories
If you''re not part of them
Any photograph without you
Would never grace my wall
I don''t wanna stand alone
(Refrain)
Then I see you there
And I visualize, both of us touching, both of us touching
Then I hold you here
Can feel you now, I''m lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And I can''t let go cos I wont let go
I will keep holding, I will keep holding
When I clear my yes, to wipe away the tears
Everything shatters, everything''s gone
And I never heard my heart beat, till the first night you were gone
I never felt so lonely, I didn''t want to be alone

Funny how time fly''s by when you''re in love

I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn''t show your spirit quite as true
You were turning ''round to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes
Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small
Though it hasn''t really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn''t what was happening at all
Although for a while our path did seem to climb
When you see through love''s illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You''ve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You''ve had to hide sometimes, but now you''re all right
And it''s good to see your smiling face tonight
Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And all the future''s there for anyone to change, still you know it seems
It would be easier sometimes to change the past
I''m just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at love''s pain and heartache school
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you
There''s this loneliness springing up from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You''ve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You''ve had to hide sometimes but now you''re all right
And it''s good to see your smiling face tonight
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You''ve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight

To keep understanding and compassion in sight
You could be laughing at me, you''ve got the right

Searching for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brought ''em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash ''em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro, used to play it across his knees
I''d give old Curt my money, he''d play all day for me
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
''Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whip me but I''d go see him again
I''d clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He''d play me a song or two then take another drink of wine.
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
''Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
Yes sir
On the day old Curtis died, nobody came to pray
Ol'' preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay
But he lived a lifetime playin'' the black man''s blues
And on the day he lost his life, that''s all he had to lose
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said he was useless, them people all are fools
''Cause Curtis you''re the finest picker to ever play the blues

Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day

Curse the day is long
Realize you don''t belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn''t know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a General
Without a mission
Until the war will start again... start again.

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now

Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees

That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight

Realize you don''t belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now

If you thinking of battling - you''re gone!

And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon'' have to beat it up out of him

I''ve got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate ''em
And the fans will lift hands, we''ll be dancin'' out of ''em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of ''em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of ''em

Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass

I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ''em be impotent

I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I''m living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I''m a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make ''em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I''mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I''m rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ''em, beat ''em ''til they be gone feed ''em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ''em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic''s
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I''m grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause that''s what it''s like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I''d try to set a big enough fire
That''ll trigger the sprinkler system
And I''d escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy''s wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
''Cause when I pick up a pen I''m venomous
And I''m as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You''ve been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I''m the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin'' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I''ll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this''ll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity
That I''m thinkin'' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ''em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I''m picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I''ll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin'' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I''m a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
LIke it''s my job to say
That you''re not a real artist, but it''s my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you''re not lookin'' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don''t wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin'' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I''m the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin'' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I''m floggin'' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who''s having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he''s the evil enemy it''ll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I''m gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don''t wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I''m hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got ''em, and we killing ''em in this bitch
If you ain''t in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that''s it

From all the things that we are

Can we see beyond the stars.

And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you
What about now?
What about today?
What if you''re making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it''s lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it''s too late
What about now?

To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you
